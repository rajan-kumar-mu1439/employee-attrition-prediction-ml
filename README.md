<h1>Employee Attrition Prediction Using Machine Learning</h1>

👉Summary

-> A machine learning model that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the organization based on historical HR data.

👉Overview

Employee attrition is a business problem.

High attrition leads to increased hiring costs, loss of expertise, and reduced productivity.

👉Problem Statement

Goal:
Build a predictive model that classifies whether an employee will leave (Yes / No) using historical employee data.

👉 Dataset

Source:<a href="https://github.com/rajan-kumar-mu1439/employee-attrition-prediction-ml/blob/main/Employee-Attrition.csv">Employee Attrition Dataset</a>

Key Features: Age, Job Role, Monthly Income, Years at Company,Job Satisfaction, Work-Life Balance, Overtime, Performance Rating

Target Variable: Attrition (Yes / No)

👉Technologies:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib / Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Modeling Techniques: Logistic Regression

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

👉 Methods (Step-by-Step)

1️. Data Loading & Inspection

2️. Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values

3️. Encoding Categorical Variables

4️. Feature Selection

5️. Train-Test Split

6️. Model Training (Logistic Regression)

7️. Model Evaluation

8️. Performance Visualization

📊 Dashboard / Model Output

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix

👉Output Includes:

True Positives (Correct Attrition Prediction)

False Positives (Wrong Attrition Alarm)

Precision, Recall, F1-Score



✅ Results & Conclusion

The model successfully identifies employees at risk of leaving

Logistic Regression proves effective for binary classification

This project demonstrates practical ML usage, not just algorithm memorization.

🚀 Future Work

-> Try advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)

-> Handle class imbalance using SMOTE

-> Build a real-time web dashboard

_> Deploy the model using Flask / FastAPI
